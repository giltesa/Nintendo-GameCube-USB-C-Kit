# Nintendo GameCube: USB-C Kit

The **Nintendo GameCube: USB-C Kit** is a board that allows to replace the original power connector for a modern and standard USB-C.

**If your original connector / power supply is too old or damaged** and you need a new one, or **if you would like to power up your Nintendo GameCube with a standard USB-C PD charger**, such as the charger for your phone, or laptop, you can do so with this kit.

## HOW DOES IT WORK?

The **USB-C Power Delivery technology (USB-C PD)** allows for communication between the device and the charger, enabling the negotiation of the voltage to be supplied through the USB-C cable. In this case, the microchip included in this board is configured to request 12V, signaling to the charger that it requires 12V to operate. If the charger is compatible, it will supply the requested voltage. If it’s not compatible, nothing will happen, and the Nintendo GameCube won’t be able to power on.
